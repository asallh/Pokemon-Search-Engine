# Pokemon-Search-Engine
 A pokedex style search engine to access pokemon type and quickly find quick general innformation to aid in general gameplay for ease of type comparison, for weakness's and super effective's

### Current Position:
- Working on a Dynamic programming approach utilizing a JSON file of all pokemon to allow for more efficient code rather than manually inputting over 800 pokemon üëç (COMPLETE)

- Need to address issue in the case that a pokemon only has a single type (Complete)


- Need to fix: 

1) Search no longer working with the implementation of the Dynamic Genration of the Pokemon


### DATA
All Pokemon images and data for the pokemon aquired from Kaggle @Vishal Subbiah (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types)

Shout outs to you homie :) 

### MOTIVATION
I am creating this porject as I have been playing Pokemon since I was  child and have played through Gen 1 to Gen 4 spending way too much time memorizing pokemon rather than my multiplications times tables at the time.

As a grew older my obsessionn certainly reduced but noy my love for Pokemon, as I would continue to play each new game that comes out every year. With new generations comes new features, and with one of them down the line being the pokemon type, Fairy.

Once fairy pokemon were introduced, it was a new powerful type that many quickly fell in love with, and teh reason being is its strength, and difficulty to counter. My problem, I could not for the life of me remember what the type weakness of fairy is. With the added addition of secondary typeing and some moves simply not impacting various pokemon, finding particular weakness's againnst some pokemon became a google search with a couple too many searches that i'd like to admit. 

Therefore, the pokemon search engine idea was born, where pokemonn typings, with super effectives, and weakness's could be easily found by siply searching the name of the pokemon.

Therefore this would be the perfect companion app for those starting out their very first pokemon journey, or those who cannnot remember what the weakness of fairy types are (it's poison and steel btw).
