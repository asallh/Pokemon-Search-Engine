Shout outs to you homie :) 

### MOTIVATION
I am creating this project as I have been playing Pokemon since I was child and have played through Gen 1 to Gen 4 spending way too much time memorizing pokemon rather than my multiplications times tables at the time.

As I grew older my obsession certainly reduced but not my love for Pokemon, as I would continue to play each new game that comes out every year. With each new generation comes new features, and one of them being the pokemon type, Fairy.

Once fairy pokemon were introduced, it was a new powerful type that many quickly fell in love with, and the reason being is its strength, and difficulty to counter. My problem, I could not for the life of me remember what the type weakness of fairy is. With the added addition of secondary typing and some moves simply not impacting various pokemon, finding particular weakness's against some pokemon became a google search with a couple too many searches that i'd like to admit. 

Therefore, the pokemon companion app idea was born. Where pokemon typings, with super effectives, and weakness's could be easily found by simply searching the name of the pokemon.

Therefore this would be the perfect companion app for those starting out their very first pokemon journey, or those who cannnot remember what the weakness of fairy types are (it's poison and steel btw).
